        <h2>Experience</h2>
         <h3 class ="style"> US Army - Urban Search and Rescue</h3>
        <p>My role as a sergeant in the United States Army solidified my leadership skills as I led teams of up to 150 soldiers in a fast-paced, dynamic work environment. Through consistent and intense training, I have gained a comprehensive background in leadership, strategic planning, risk management, and critical thinking. The Army gave me the necessary training in how to develop strategic plans as well as implement these plans.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
         <h3 class = "style">Biola University - Masters of Divinity </h3>
        <p>My Master's of Divinity with an emphasis in spiritual formation has granted me the vocabulary to articulate aspects of spiritual growth and human development, which many people find hard to articulate. The depth of this course work was focused on human development and how spirituality interacts with a person's growth. This has enabled me to help people during crisis in their life to foster a sense of purpose and hope.</p>
