        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a veteran and chaplain which gives me uniques skills. As a chaplain I spent a lot of time learning how to listen to people. As well as reflecting  back to them properly what they were saying to me. As a soldier I was trained in a variety of jobs. These jobs were plumbing, carpentry, and urban search and rescue among other things. Now I am interested in expanding my skills through front end development, which will allow me to bring my ideas as well as other people's ideas to the world.</p>
        <p>My background has prepared me to be able work with different groups of people. To be able to see problems and solve them. From being a chaplain I am able to understand people heart behind what they are saying. And from my years as a soldier I am able to execute projects and plans in a timely manner. All this will help me as I go into front end development.</p>
